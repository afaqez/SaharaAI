**About The Department**
------------------------

The Department of Civil Engineering is dedicated to produce quality professional engineers with abilities to design, manage and operate Civil Engineering based fields. These objectives are achieved through OBE (Outcome Based Education) system as per Washington Accord. The Department of Civil Engineering through outstanding faculty and state of the art lab facilities ensures that the engineers of tomorrow are not only well equipped theoretically but also have hands-on training of modern engineering tools, e.g. European made 20,000 kN Servo-Hydraulic Machine (UTM), European made flow channel, Italian made 50 kN tension/compression tri-axial machine, etc. A highly conducive environment including not only class and lab learning but also co-curricular activities, enables the student to grow professionally as well as personally & ethically. The department is also offering graduate program in four specializations areas. There are five major research groups where the faculty is actively involved in research activities. The MS/PhD students are associated with these research groups that give them the practical experience and flavor of modern technological research.

“My passion for construction and civil engineering has led me through amazing adventures in these past few years. Originally belonging to Quetta, Baluchistan, I travelled to the Capital in pursuit of gaining indepth knowledge and exploring the unknowns of the civil world. Through state of the art laboratories, highly qualified faculty, and outcome based education (OBE) system, CUST has ignited a fire within and has helped me to gain a better understanding of the engineering world. While at CUST, I also interacted with people from all parts of the country enriching my understandings of different customs and enhancing my interpersonal skills.  
Alongside the academic activities, extracurricular activities are also an integral part of CUST. The various societies and clubs have not only groomed me professionally but also has helped me discover my talent and refine my skills. I was honored to serve as the President of ASCE-Capital Chapter; a great platform to interact with civil engineers globally. Diversity and inclusion are an important part of the values at CUST and all the societies and clubs adore by these values.  
I was humbled by the opportunity to be a part of the learning environment of CUST, and I’m using my knowledge, resources, and skills for the betterment of my people and the society as a whole. “
