**About The Department**
------------------------

The status of English as a lingua franca and the language of communication, science, education, and the internet has increased manifold with every passing day. To equip the youth with contemporary knowledge and experiences, it is imperative to provide them with suitable opportunities to learn and practice English language with an understanding of its linguistic and literary aspects. The objectives of the department include facilitating students to communicate confidently and creatively, exposing them to modern linguistic and literary developments, and helping them contribute to society efficiently and effectively. The academic calendar includes programs for undergrads and research scholars, starting with BS English from Fall 2021. The wide range of multidisciplinary courses in BS English will broaden the critical thinking skills of the students helping them to become competent and creative in linguistic and literary studies. The department is equipped with experienced faculty competent in linguistics and literature. The instructional leadership is trained to guide the students in their respective area of study and will assist them to become constructive members of the society. The department has planned to offer MS and PhD programs in linguistics and literature, launch an ELT journal, and establish an English Language Centre. _“Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.” ― Socrates_
