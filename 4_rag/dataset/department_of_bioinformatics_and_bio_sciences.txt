**About The Department**
------------------------

The Department of Bioinformatics and Biosciences is working with a mission â€˜to provide quality education and facilitate research activities to cater ever changing environment in life sciences, to diverse student population, while maintaining a high degree of ethical and social values. The department promotes excellence in interdisciplinary biological research by encouraging independent and original work and training. Furthermore, to enhance the understanding of concepts and to have a hand-on experience, most of the courses are supported by wet lab and research-based assignments. To provide hand-on expertise to students, department has established state-of-the-art lab facilities, including fully equipped labs for instructions and research, tissue culture lab, bioinformatics labs. The Department now offers BS programs in Biotechnology, Microbiology and Biochemistry as well as the graduate program in Biosciences. Biotechnology is the use of living organisms to create new products and processes to improve the quality of life. This field is an application of scientific and engineering principals to process materials by the use of biological agents to deliver goods and services. It is an applied science and has a great scope in medical, agricultural, food and pharmaceutical sciences. Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms such as viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi, slime molds and protozoa. Microbiologists can pursue their careers in various fields such as agriculture, food, environment, industrial microbiology, public health, pharmaceuticals, resource management, and Academia. Biochemistry focuses on study of structure and function of biomolecules. This domain has scope in pharmaceutics, diagnostics, Ayurvedic medicine, chemical industries and many more. A number of general courses in the area of humanities, social sciences, religion and ethics, health & physical education, languages and communication skills are made compulsory in order to provide the students with a social, psychological and religious understanding thereby ensuring a balanced personality.
