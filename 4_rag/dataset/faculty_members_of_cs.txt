#### Dr. M Abdul Qadir

PROFESSOR / DEAN FACULTY OF COMPUTING

Twenty five years of my career can be categorized into three main areas as industry, academia and management. I am currently actively involved in teaching / R&D and academic management. I have been teaching and doing research in the development of simple and efficient algorithms to solve real-life problems by using soft computing. From times to times, I have been focusing on problems in different domains. My current focus is on semantic web, multimedia semantics, Ontologies, distributed systems and bioinformatics as is clear from more than 80 research publications in international refereed proceedings and journals. I have been playing a leading role in the management of industry and academia and have produced significant results in achieving the goals of these R&D organizations. I have played a pivotal role in the organization of three international conferences in Pakistan. I am also on the program committees of various international conferences. I have presented myscholarly work in many conferences all over the world. In the first five years of my carrier I was involved in the design and development of systems in the areas of Electronic (analogue & digital), Integration of Electronics with Optics, Development of interfaces between heterogeneous electronics systems / modules by different vendors, system level production facility design and management, understanding the ballistic computing systems for main battle tanks, Integration of thermal imaging system with existing ballistic computers, and successful tests & field trials of these systems in the main battle tanks. My multi-dimensional experience of work in industry, academia, management and consultancy in different sectors has been an excellent help to solve high-tech challenging problems as well as to lead projects & organizations. I enjoy an exceptional combination of technical and communication skills which have always been helpful in getting work done from all the team members.
